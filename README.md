# Marlin LCD Screen Editor
This software is meant to aid in the designing of custom bootscreens and perhaps in the future also statusscreens for [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin). It is a rather early proof of concept, so a bunch of features are still missing or not yet fully implemented.

Do note that this is not an official product by Marlin Firmware. This software is not in any way, shape or form supported nor endorsed by Marlin Firmware.

# Current Features
â€¢ __WYSIWYG Editor__ - The chosen screen's layout is neatly presented to you in a grid, essentially what you paint is what you'll get.  
â€¢ __Code Generator__ - Generates the code for you, simply replace the default code.  
â€¢ __Share Designs__ - _Currently_ uses a rather basic binary-based string to share designs, you can load and share this string with other people. This will be optimized later.  

Again I want to re-iterate that this is a work in progress. It started as a personal project to help me design my own custom screen instead of fiddling with photoshop and converting it online - then I decided to clean things up and publish it in case other people may find it useful.

As such I can't really guarantee that I'll continue working on this in the future. But at the very least I want to get the planned features implemented and working.

As always, any and all feedback is welcome. Let me know if you have any suggestions or whatnot and of course feel free to contribute! :heart:
